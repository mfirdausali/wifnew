## ðŸŽ¯ Final Verification Steps

### Step 1: Backend Verification
```bash
# Check backend is running
curl http://localhost:5001/api/health

# Response should be:
# {"success":true,"message":"Server is healthy","data":{"timestamp":"..."}}
```

### Step 2: Frontend Verification
1. Open http://localhost:3000/login in your browser
2. You should see a styled login page with:
   - Gray background
   - White card with shadow
   - Blue login button
   - Form fields with proper styling

### Step 3: Authentication Flow Test
1. Login with one of these credentials:
   - Admin: `admin@example.com` / `password123`
   - Sales: `sales@example.com` / `password123`
   - Finance: `finance@example.com` / `password123`
   - Operations: `operations@example.com` / `password123`

2. After login, you should be redirected to the appropriate dashboard:
   - Admin â†’ `/admin`
   - Sales â†’ `/sales`
   - Finance â†’ `/finance`
   - Operations â†’ `/operations`

3. Each dashboard shows:
   - Welcome message with user's name
   - Role-specific content
   - Navigation menu
   - Logout button

### Step 4: Authorization Test
1. As a Sales user, try accessing `/admin` - should redirect to login
2. As an Admin user, you can access all dashboards
3. Logout button should return you to login page

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If login redirects back immediately:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify cookies are being set (DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Cookies)
3. Ensure frontend is running on http://localhost:3000 (not https)

### If UI looks unstyled:
1. Check that Tailwind CSS is compiling (terminal should show compilation)
2. Hard refresh the browser (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
3. Clear browser cache

### If backend errors occur:
1. Check Docker is running: `docker ps`
2. Verify database connection: `docker exec -it wifnew-postgres-1 psql -U wifuser -d wifdb`
3. Check Redis: `docker exec -it wifnew-redis-1 redis-cli ping`
